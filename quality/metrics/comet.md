description: Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation
---

**COMET** (Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation) is a metric based on token or sentence embeddings.
It is based on similarity of vector representations.

> Traditionally only QE models have made use of the source input, whereas MT evaluation metrics rely instead on the reference translation. [...], we show that using a multilingual embedding space allows us to leverage information from all three inputs and demonstrate the value added by the source as input to our MT evaluation models.

COMET is trained on predicting different types of human judgements in the form of post-editing effort, direct assessment or translation error analysis.
