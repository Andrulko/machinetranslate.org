description: Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering
---

**METEOR** (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) is an [n-gram](/../concepts/n-gram.md) word-based metric.
It is used for evaluation.

> Meteor evaluates a translation by computing a score based on explicit word-to-word matches between the translation and a given reference translation.

Apart from exact word matching, METEOR adds matching for synonyms and simple morphological variants of a word.

METEOR takes into account both the precision and recall while evaluating a match.
