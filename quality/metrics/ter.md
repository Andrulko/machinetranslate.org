**Translation Error Rate** (**TER**) is an error metric for machine translation that measures the number of edits required to change a system output into one of the references.

> TER is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to change a hypothesis so that it exactly matches one of the references, normalized by the average length of the references.

TER corresponds to [post-editing effort](https://machinetranslate.org/post-editing#metrics).
