description: CHaRacter-level F-score
---

**chrF** (CHaRacter-level F-score) was introduced in 2015 by Maja Popovic.
chrF is a string-based metric.

The chrF metric compares the machine translation output with reference translations, looking at character sequences. Character sequences matching help in recognizing different forms of a single word.

> It is language-independent, tokenisation-independent and it shows good correlations with human judgments both on the system- as well as with on the segment-level, especially the CHRF3 variant.
