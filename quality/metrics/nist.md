**NIST** (**National Institute of Standards and Technology**) is a evaluation metric based on [n-gram](/../concepts/n-gram.md) similarity.

NIST is an adaptation of [BLEU](bleu.md).

Compared to BLEU, NIST gives more importance to the less frequent n-grams.

> The NIST metric is derived from the BLEU evaluation criterion but differs in one fundamental aspect: instead of n-gram precision, the information gain from each n-gram is taken into account.
