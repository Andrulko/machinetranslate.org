A **vector** is a unique fixed-sized list of numbers.
Each vector number is called coordinate.
Coordinates define the vector's position in a particular space.
Vectors represent data in a way that a machine learning model can understand and use.
In machine translation, vectors represent the words and phrases in a text.

Example of a vector:

`cat` = [4564]

Each coordinate corresponds to a specific aspect of the word or phrase.

Vector information:

- Part of speech
- Tense
- Word relationship to other words in the sentence


Vectors help algorithms to analyse the structure and meaning of an input text, and determine its translation.
For example, vectors can help to identify a sentence subject and verb, and then use this information to generate a translation.

Vectors can also be used to represent the relationship between different parts of a text.
For example, a vector can represent the similarity between two sentences.

Vectors can be useful to identify output sentences that are grammatically correct, but are not accurate translations.
