description: Splitting a text into a sequence of sentences
---

**Sentence splitting** is the process of converting a text into a sequence of sentences.
Sentence splitting is an essential step in machine translation to build [parallel data](/customisation/parallel-data.md) that is [aligned](/customisation/alignment.md) at the sentence level.
Alignment at the sentence level is necessary in machine translation to make training efficient.
