description: The set of supported words
---

The **vocabulary** of a model is the set of supported words.
In a machine translation system, the vocabulary may refer to the set of words supported in either the input.
A word that's supported in the output is a word that can be generated by the translation system.
A word that's supported in the input is a word that can be translated.

Typically the vocabulary is created from training data by retaining the most frequent `N` words in the source and target language.
Words that are not in the vocabulary are called out-of-vocabulary (OOV).

The vocabulary of a language is the set of all possible words in the language.

The vocabulary of a pretrained word embedding model is the set of all words with defined embeddings.

## Challenges

- A large vocabulary will allow the system to learn to translate more words, but makes the model much larger and slower
- If pretrained word embeddings are used, the vocabulary is already determined to a degree
- Open-class words present challenges, such as proper names and numbers
- Agglutinative and highly inflected languages have very large vocabularies, and may require massive amounts of training data to observe enough of the vocabulary

## Dependencies

- The vocabulary is affected by choice of tokenisation algorithm or the use of subword models such as byte-pair encoding
- The vocabulary is affected by preprocessing of capitalization and accents
- Out of vocabulary words may be handled by other mechanisms such as byte-pair encoding or copy mechanisms. It can be better to translate rare words as out-of-vocabulary rather than in-vocabulary.
