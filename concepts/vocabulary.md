description: The set of supported words
---

The **vocabulary** of a model is the set of supported words.
In a machine translation system, the vocabulary may refer to the set of words supported in either the input or the output.
A word that's supported in the output is a word that can be generated by the translation system.
A word that's supported in the input is a word that can be translated.

Typically the vocabulary is created from training data by retaining the most frequent `N` words in the source and target language.
Words that are not in the vocabulary are called out-of-vocabulary (OOV).

The vocabulary of a language is the set of all possible words in the language.

The vocabulary of a pretrained word embedding model is the set of all words with defined embeddings.

## Challenges

- A large vocabulary will allow the system to learn to translate more words, but makes the model much larger and slower
- If pretrained word embeddings are used, the vocabulary is already determined and not trivial to update with new data
- Open-class words present challenges, such as proper names and numbers
- Agglutinative and highly inflected languages have very large vocabularies, and may require massive amounts of training data to observe enough of the vocabulary

## Dependencies

- The vocabulary is affected by choice of tokenisation algorithm or the use of subword models such as byte-pair encoding.
- The vocabulary is affected by preprocessing of capitalization and accents.
- There are many solutions to lessen the problem of OOVs. These solutions can be effective enough that it may be better to translate rare words are OOV rather than include them in the vocabulary. This leads to more complexity when choosing the appropriate vocabulary size for a model
