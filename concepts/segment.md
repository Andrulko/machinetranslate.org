A segment is a unit in a document or other file processed by a computer-aided translation (CAT) tool. 
Segment content depends on the type of translated content:
- In a document, a segment is usually a sentence or equivalent.
- In a spreadsheet, a segment is a cell.
- In user interface resource files, a segment can be a menu option, a text on a button, a field label, an error message text, etc.

Segment pertains to a [string](string.md), however, it can either be plain text or can also include [tags or placeholders](../applications/advanced-concepts/tags-and-placeholders.md).

Segments coupled into source-target pairs are called translation units that are building blocks of a translation memory. 
Splitting text into segments allows to apply matches from translation memory and to identify repetitions.
