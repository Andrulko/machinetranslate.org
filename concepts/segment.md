A segment is a unit in a document or other file processed by a computer-aided translation (CAT) tool. 
Segments coupled into source-target pairs are building blocks of translation memory. 
Splitting text into segments allows to apply matches from translation memory and to identify repetitions.

Segment content depends on the type of translated content:
- In a document, a segment is usually a sentence or equivalent.
- In a spreadsheet, a segment is a cell.
- In user interface resource files, a segment can be a menu option, a text on a button, a field label, an error message text, etc.

Segment is a [string](string.md).  
Segment can be plain text or can include [tags or placeholders](../applications/advanced-concepts/tags-and-placeholders.md).
