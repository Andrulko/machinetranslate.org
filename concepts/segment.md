A segment is a unit that is part of a document or other file that is processed by a Computer-Aided Translation tool (CAT).
Segments paired into source-target units are building blocks of translation memory. 
Splitting text into such units allows to assign matches from translation memory and to identify repetitions.

Segment content depends on the type of translated content:
- In a document, a segment is usually a sentence or equivalent.
- In a spreadsheet, a segment is a cell.
- In user interface resource files, a segment can be a menu option, a text on a button, a field label, an error message text, etc.

Segment is a [string](string.md).  
Segment can be plain text or can include [tags or placeholders](../applications/advanced-concepts/tags-and-placeholders.md).
