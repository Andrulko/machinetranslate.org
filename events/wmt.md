title: WMT
description: Conference on Machine Translation
name: WMT
---

**WMT** is the main event for machine translation and machine translation research.  The conference is held annually in connection with larger conferences on natural language processing.

> The conference aims to bring together academic scientists, researchers and industry representatives to exchange and share their experiences and research results. WMT plays a key role for the entire industry of computational linguistics and machine translation.

In 2006, the first **Workshop on Machine Translation** was held at the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing conference (EMNLP).  It was organised by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

In 2016, with the rise of [neural machine translation](approaches/neural-machine-translation.md), WMT became a conference of its own.  The **Conference on Machine Translation** is still mainly known as *WMT*.


## Shared tasks

WMT hosts shared tasks competitions prior to the conference. During the shared tasks, researchers tackle specific challenges from a list of themes. Researchers then compare their techniques against the techniques of other researchers in the field.

During the main conference, researchers present the results of the shared tasks and winners are announced.

WMT started in 2006 with a *translation* task. In the following editions, WMT included themes on all aspects of machine translation, corpus preparation, training, and evaluation.

### 2022 shared tasks

- General machine translation task (former News task)
- Biomedical translation task
- Automatic post-editing task
- Metrics task
- Quality estimation task
- Machine translation using terminologies task
- Chat translation task
- Sign language translation task
- Robustness translation task
- Triangual machine translation task
- Large-scale multilingual machine translation task

The results published from WMT shared tasks represent benchmarks for the technology.
