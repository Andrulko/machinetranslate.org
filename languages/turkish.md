description: Machine translation for Turkish
---

The first studies on machine translation in **Turkish** started to emerge in the 90s. Most of these studies were experimental studies and have not reached general-purpose use level.

In addition to machine translation systems designed for the English-Turkish language pair, systems have also been developed between Turkic languages ​​such as Uyghur, Turkmen, Azerbaijani and Tatar.

Although machine translation systems are easier to develop due to the structural closeness between Turkic languages, they also have their own unique challenges. One of these difficulties is the lack of resources in Turkic languages.

Turkish belongs to the Ural-Altaic language family and is an agglutinative language. In Turkish, words are formed by adding inflections and suffixes to the root word. Thousands of new words can be derived from root words with suffixes.

Turkish is a language that has some difficulties in terms of machine translation. Especially, its structural difference with languages ​​such as English, French and German, in which most studies in this field are conducted, is one of the biggest difficulties in terms of Turkish.

The fact that Turkish doesn't have enough parallel corpora to generate training data is one of the reasons that makes it difficult to develop a language model. Today, while there are many large-scale parallel corpora for Western languages, parallel corpora for Turkish are still under development.

In 1993, İlker Hamzaoğlu developed a word-based machine translation system that translates between the Turkish-Azerbaijani language pair.

One of the first projects on machine translation systems in Turkey was supported by NATO within the scope of the Science for Stability Program in 1994, and the TU-Dil Project was developed in order to create a foundation for natural language processing research in Turkish.

Another study is the English-Turkish Interlanguage Machine translation system, designed in collaboration with academics from Bilkent and Carnegie Melon University in 1998.

In 2001, Kemal Altıntaş developed a machine translation system from Turkish to Crimean Tatar language using finite state techniques.

In 2003, Şenkal, Gürgör, and Kardeş developed a machine translation model for the Turkish-Spanish language pair.

In 2006, a Turkish-English statistical machine translation system was developed by ‪İlknur Durgar El-Kahlout‬ and Kemal Oflazer, and it was aimed to find solutions to the problems arising from the structural differences between the two languages.

In 2007, a Turkmen-Turkish machine translation system was developed by Tantuğ, Adalı and Oflazer. In this system, hybrid method is used and it consists of both information and rule-based and statistical components.

A Turkish-English machine translation system was designed by Türe in 2008. This system was based on the hybrid approach that combining the classical transfer-based approach with the statistical approach. This system would find the possible English equivalents of Turkish clauses based on the manual transfer rules, and then the probabilistic language model would choose the most probable of these translations.

In another work in 2008, Cengizhan Tekin established the infrastructure of a rule-based machine translation module from English to Turkish and prepared an initial project.

Some statistical machine translation studies were conducted by Köprü in 2009 and by Yeniterzi and Oflazer in 2010.

In 2010, a Uyghur-Turkish machine translation system was developed by Orhun, Adalı and Tantuğ.
