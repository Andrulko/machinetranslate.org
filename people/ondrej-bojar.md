**Ondřej Bojar** is a researcher and associate professor at the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/) at Charles University in Prague, widely cited for his work on statistical and later [neural machine translation](/neural-machine-translation).
He co-authored Moses, a kit for [statistical machine translation](/statistical-machine-translation) and is a long-term organizer of [WMT](/community/communities.md#workshop_on_statistical_machine_translation).

His work goes beyond mainstream machine translation, such as interactive machine translation, post-editing or psycholinguistical aspects of machine translation usage.
