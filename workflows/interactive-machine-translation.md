description: Workflow for human translation with word completion

**Interactive machine translation** (IMT) helps human translators type translations with a predictive text input system.
Unlike traditional predictive text, IMT uses the machine translation model to provide better completions of the sentence.

## Challenges

- The translation model is generally good for nouns, verbs, and open-domain words but the regular LM is better for closed-domain, so they struggle to combine those right.

## TODO

- If possible, get stats on efficiency of IMT vs PE
- If possible, include a diagram
