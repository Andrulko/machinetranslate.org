description: Workflow for human translation with word completion
---

**Interactive machine translation** helps human translators by integrating machine translation into a predictive text input user interface.
As the translator types, the system shows sentence completions produced by both a machine translation model and a language model of the current, partially-typed translation.

## Challenges

- The translation model is generally good for nouns, verbs, and open-domain words but the regular LM is better for closed-domain, so they struggle to combine those right.

## TODO

- If possible, get stats on efficiency of IMT vs PE
- If possible, include a diagram
