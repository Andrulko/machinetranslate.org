**Interactive machine translation** (IMT) helps human translators type translations with a predictive text input system.
Unlike traditional predictive text, IMT uses the machine translation model to provide better completions of the sentence.

IMT is also called interactive translation prediction or predictive machine translation.

## Challenges

- It can be challenging to combine probabilities from the target-side language model with the machine translation model.

## TODO

- If possible, get stats on efficiency of IMT vs PE
- If possible, include a screenshot
