Machine translation products include ready-to-use machine translation APIs and applications. Systems can also be made available via integrations.

They vary by:

- language support
- accuracy
- price
- customisation options
- data confidentiality

and other features, as well as underlying architecture.


Some of the most popular MT providers offer off-the-shelf solutions, i.e. trained MT models that are ready-to-use and can be integrated immediately. An alternative is to train a model from scratch, deploy it and maintain it.

The main advantage of ready-to-use systems is that they are a one-size-fits-all solution, for example they can be used for any text domain. When used in an application, text segmentation and language identification are usually provided. On the other hand, a model trained from scratch might yield better performance on a specific domain if trained on a large amount of high-quality domain-specific bilingual data. However, training and maintaining such models can be a complex task and it requires specific competences.
Some machine translation providers also offer large pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned. A common application scenario is one where a  pre-trained model is fine-tuned with a relatively small domain-specific data set to achieve high performance on specific contents.


Providers offer their machine translation services via a platform, an API or both. Some providers offer limited services for free or paid full services.
