# Warren Weaver
Warren Weaver was an American scientist who designed several methods for developing Machine translation in 1949.

The methods included the use of wartime cryptography techniques, Shannonâ€™s information theory, 
statistical analysis and juxtaposition of logic and universal features of language.

With this method, research in Machine translation was ignited and the first conference was convened. 
The submitted papers leaned on controlled languages, construction of a sublanguage, as well as pre- and post-editing.
