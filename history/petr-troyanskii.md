# Petr Troyanskii
Petr Troyanskii was an educator and scholar. In 1935, he filed and received USSR Patent 40995 for his invention. 

The machine selected and typed words when translating from one language to another 
or across multiple languages simultaneously.

The method suggested coding and interpreting grammatical functions using universal symbols. 
The interlingual grammatical rules were based on Esperanto. In the same years, 
[Georges Artsrouni] (history/georges-artsrouni.md) independently filed a patent in Paris. 

Troyanskii entered the University of St. Petersburg but did not finish it due to World War I. 
Later he studied at the Institute of Red Professors. 

He taught social sciences and the history of science and technology. 
He considered mechanizing translation the cause of his whole life.
