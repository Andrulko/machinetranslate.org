# Petr Troyanskii
Petr Troyanskii was an educator and scholar who came up with an automatic bilingual dictionary in 1933. 

The method suggested coding and interpreting grammatical functions using universal symbols. 
The interlingual grammatical rules were based on Esperanto.

Troyanskii entered the University of St. Petersburg but did not finish it due to World War I. 
Later he studied at the Institute of Red Professors. 

He taught social sciences and the history of science and technology. 
He considered mechanising translation the cause of his whole life.
