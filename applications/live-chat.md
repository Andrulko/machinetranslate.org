# Live Chat

Machine translation for **live chat** is used to translate messages between two users who do not speak a common language.

Live chat messages are a type of [user-generated content](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/pull/user-generated-content). Live chat is challenging for machine-translation because it is noisy and context-dependent.

Common scenarios are in-game chat in **gaming** and customer support for [commerce and marketplaces](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/pull/commerce-and-marketplaces).
