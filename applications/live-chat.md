# Live Chat

In **Live Chats**, machine translation assists in interactions between people speaking different languages. Each user sends messages in their own language, which get translated before reaching the other person. This means that both inbound and outbound messages are machine translated in real time.

The main benefit of this technology is that it reduces delays in the communication by first detecting the user language and then providing fast translations.
