# Live chat

Machine translation for **live chat** is used to translate messages between two users who do not speak a common language.

Live chat messages are a type of [user-generated content](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/tree/415ba6e66b12dcd38178a7a4a36cf01cc08e18c2/applications/applications/user-generated-content.md). Live chat is challenging for machine-translation because it is noisy and context-dependent.

Common scenarios are in-game chat in [gaming](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/tree/415ba6e66b12dcd38178a7a4a36cf01cc08e18c2/applications/applications/gaming.md) and customer support for [commerce and marketplaces](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/tree/415ba6e66b12dcd38178a7a4a36cf01cc08e18c2/applications/applications/commerce-and-marketplaces.md).
