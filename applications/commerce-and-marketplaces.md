# Commerce and Marketplaces
Machine translation for **commerce and marketplaces** is the translation of product content, like product titles and descriptions, into the languages of consumers.

The goals are:

- sales conversion
- **SEO** and site search
- customer support

The top merchants and platforms cannot human-translate all products into all languages, because of the scale.

The translation of product titles and descriptions is handled by the platforms, merchants or brands themselves.

### Content types

- Product
- Product descriptions
- Product reviews
- Customer support chat and email
