# Commerce and marketplaces

Machine translation for **commerce and marketplaces** is the translation of product content, like product titles and descriptions, into the languages of buyers.

The goals are:

* sales conversion
* [SEO](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/tree/415ba6e66b12dcd38178a7a4a36cf01cc08e18c2/applications/applications/seo.md) and site search
* customer support

The top merchants and platforms cannot human-translate all products into all languages, because of the scale.

The translation of product titles and descriptions is handled by the platforms, merchants or brands themselves.

## Content types

* Product titles
* Product descriptions
* Product reviews
* Customer support [chat](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/tree/415ba6e66b12dcd38178a7a4a36cf01cc08e18c2/applications/applications/live-chat/README.md) and email
