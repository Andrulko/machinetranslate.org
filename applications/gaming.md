# Gaming

Machine translation for **gaming** is the translation for in-game and out-of-game text.

For machine translation, gaming is challenging because the content is creative and context-dependent. In-game translation is challenging because of length restrictions.

Gaming content is not a fit for pure human translation if it is created and updated often or continuously streaming.

### Content Types

In-game
 - On-screen text and art assets
 - UI
 - Subtitles
 - [Live chat](applications/live-chat.md)

Out-of-game
- Packaging and documents
- Websites
- Marketing
