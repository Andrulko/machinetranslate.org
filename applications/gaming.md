# Gaming

Machine translation for **gaming** is the translation of in-game and out-of-game text.

For machine translation, gaming is challenging because the content is creative and context-dependent. In-game translation is challenging because of length restrictions.

Gaming content is not a fit for pure human translation if it is created and updated often or continuously streaming.

## Content Types

In-game:

* UI strings
* On-screen text and images
* Subtitles
* [Live chat](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/tree/415ba6e66b12dcd38178a7a4a36cf01cc08e18c2/applications/applications/live-chat.md)

Out-of-game:

* Packaging and documents
* Websites
* Marketing
