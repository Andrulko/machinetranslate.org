# Gaming

Machine translation for **gaming** is the translation for in-game and out-of-game text.

For machine translation, gaming is challenging because the content is creative and context-dependent. In-game translation is challenging because of length restrictions.

The goal of machine translation in gaming is to reach multilingual audiences. Machine translation is a fast solution for continuous content updates.

### Content Types

In-game
 - On-screen text and art assets
 - UI
