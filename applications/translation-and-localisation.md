description: Machine translation for translation and localisation

Machine translation is a key technology in professional **translation and localisation** workflows.

### Definitions

#### Translation
Translation is the transformation of a text or speech transcript in the source language into a text in the target language.

#### Localisation
Localisation is the transformation of an object (a document, a computer programme, a film, a book) from one cultural environment to another, whereby the object retains its most salient features and features that are not transferable to another culture are replaced, as far as possible, by counterparts that are comprehensible to the audience.  
Localisation of a computer programme consists of the following steps:
1. Identifying the usability to target audiences and the features that need to be replaced or adapted.
2. Translating the content of user interface and user assistance (help).
3. Replacing or adapting the non-transferrable features.
4. Building the localised versions with target locale settings and translated content and features.
5. Testing the localised versions: 
   - Verifying the validity of translation in the programme context.
   - Verifying the validity for each target audience of the localisation aspects including:
     - national characters in user interface, user assistance and input fields
     - formats of numbers, time and date, currency, units of measurement, according to the locale
     - sort order of lists and glossaries, according to the locale
     - bi-directional display and input of text (where applicable).
  
### Integrations

Translation software, like translation management systems (TMS) and computer-aided translation tools (CAT), integrate machine translation APIs, directly or via plugins.

### Workflow

The translation software fills in the machine translation for the human translator to [post-edit](../workflows/post-editing.md).
The machine translation can be inserted in whole files at once or one [segment](../concepts/segment.md) at a time.
Some engines that translate segment-by-segment can learn from post-editions and adapt the machine translation output accordingly.

### Productivity

Post-editors work three to four times faster than traditional translators.
