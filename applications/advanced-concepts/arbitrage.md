# Arbitrage

**Arbitrage** for machine translation is the process of evaluating and picking a machine translation engine. In arbitrage, different machine translation [providers](business/providers.md) translate the same input sample. The output can be evaluated automatically or by a human.

Arbitrage is challenging because it is subjective.

### Goals

The goal of arbitrage is to find the best fit for specific machine translation needs. Results vary depending on different factors:

- Domains
- Content types
- Languages
- [Pricing](business/pricing.md)
- [Data confidentiality](business/data-confidentiality.md)
