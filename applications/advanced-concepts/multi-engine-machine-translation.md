# Multi-engine machine translation

**Multi-engine machine translation** is the process of evaluating and picking a machine translation engine. In multi-engine machine translation, different [providers](business/providers.md) translate the same input sample. The output versions are then evaluated automatically or by a human to select a provider.

Multi-engine machine translation is challenging because it is subjective.

### Goals

The goal of multi-engine machine translation is to find the best fit for specific machine translation needs.
The best fit for a particular input will vary depending on different factors:

- Domains
- Content types
- Languages
- [Pricing](business/pricing.md)
- [Data confidentiality](business/data-confidentiality.md)
