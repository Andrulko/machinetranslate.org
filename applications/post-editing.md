# Post-editing

Human **post-editing** is the review and correction of machine translation output. When post-editing, the human translator checks the original input and the machine translation output, and fixes errors in the output.

Post-editing started to replace human translation because it is faster and cheaper than the traditional human translation process.

Over the 2010s, with rising machine translation quality, it became the dominant human translation workflow.

### Flavours
With **light post-editing**, the goal is that readers understand the idea of a text. Light post-editing provides the gist of a message. It is usually aimed at internal communications.

With **full post-editing**, the goal is to match human quality. Clients may request full post-editing services for publishable information.

### Metrics
**Post-editing distance** is a measure of how much the human translator post-edited the machine translation. It's both a metric for a specific translation, and also used in aggregate.

It can be length-normalized and given as a percentage.

**Post-editing effort** is an estimate of how much from the machine translation output needs to be post-edited and how much can be approved as is.
