# Post-editing

Human **Post-editing** is the review and correction of machine translation output. When post-editing, the human translator checks the original text and fixes any error made by the machine translation.

Post-editing is a replacement of human translation as it has faster turnaround times, is cheaper, and can process larger amounts of information than the traditional human translation process.

Over the 2010s, with rising machine translation quality, it became the dominant human translation workflow.

### Flavours
With **light post-editing**, the goal is that readers understand the idea of a text. Light post-editing provides the gist of a message. It is usually aimed at internal communications.

With **full post-editing**, the goal is to match human quality. Clients may request full post-editing services for publishable information.

### Metrics
**Post-editing distance** provides a percentage of how much the text has changed from the initial to the edited version. Percentages closer to 0% will mean that the machine translation output required minimum editing. Light and full post-editing are related to expected changes percentage.

**Post-editing effort** will vary depending on the machine translation quality. The human post-editor should not take more time correction machine translation output than translating from scratch.
