# Hybrid translation

Hybrid translation is a balance between raw machine translation and post-edited text.

In hybrid translation, the machine translation output lines are classified as high risk or low risk. Low risk lines are approved as is, while high risk lines are fixed by a post-editor.

With hybrid translations, the [post-editing effort](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/pull/post-editing) is aimed at risky translations only.

### Goals

Hybrid translation is faster and cheaper than the traditional human translation process.
