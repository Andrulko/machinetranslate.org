# Hybrid translation

With **hybrid translation**, some raw machine translation lines are never seen or touched by a human translator.

With hybrid translation, the machine translation output lines are classified as high-risk or low-risk. Low-risk lines are approved as-is, while high-risk lines are [post-edited](/applications/post-editing.md) by a human translator.

## Goals

Hybrid translation is faster and cheaper than the traditional human translation process.
