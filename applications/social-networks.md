# Social Networks

Machine translation for **social networks** is integrated into social networks for gisting dynamic content on demand.

Social networks with a machine translation feature include:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- Instagram
- Sina Weibo
- YouTube


While the static content of social networks is human-translated, machine translation is used for [user-generated content](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/pull/user-generated-content).

### Content types

- Comments
- Reviews
- Posts
- Messages

On YouTube, machine translation is for subtitles, including autogenerated subtitles.
