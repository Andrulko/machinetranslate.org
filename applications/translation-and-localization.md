# Translation and localization

In the **translation and localization** industry, machine translation is used to process large amounts of content faster and cheaper than a traditional human translation.

### Integrations

Translation softwares communicate with machine translation engines through plugins and APIs.

### Workflow

The translation software automatically generates bilingual files.
[Post-editors](/applications/post-edition) work on these bilingual files reading the document input and the machine translation output, and fixing the errors in the output.

### Productivity

Post-editors work three to four times faster than traditional translators.
