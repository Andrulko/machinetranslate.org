# User-Generated Content

Machine translation for **user-generated content** (UGC) is used mainly for **gisting**.


### Goals
Machine translation can increase key platform metrics like user engagement and sales.
The amount of user-generated content published daily is non-stop. User-generated content is a good fit for machine translation because it is very high-scale.

User-generated content is challenging for machine translation because it is open-domain and noisy.

### Content types

- [Posts and comments](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/pull/social-networks)
- [Live chat](https://github.com/machinetranslate/machinetranslate.org/pull/live-chat)
