# User-generated content

Machine translation for **user-generated content** \(UGC\) is used mainly for **gisting**.

## Goals

Platforms translate their content to increase key metrics, like user engagement and sales. User-generated content is a good fit for machine translation because it is continuous and high-scale.

User-generated content is challenging for machine translation because it is open-domain and noisy.

## Content types
