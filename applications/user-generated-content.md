# User-Generated Content

Machine translation for **user-generated content** (UGC) is used mainly for **gisting**.


### Goals
Platforms translate their content to increase key metrics, like user engagement and sales.
User-generated content is a good fit for machine translation because it is continuous and high-scale.

User-generated content is challenging for machine translation because it is open-domain and noisy.

### Content types

- [Posts and comments](applications/social-networks.md)
- [Live chat](applications/live-chat.md)
- [Product titles, descriptions and reviews](applications/commerce-and-marketplaces.md)
- [In-game content](applications/gaming.md)
