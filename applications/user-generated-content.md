# User-Generated Content

**User-generated content (USG)** is content created and shared through websites and social media. Machine translation is used in UGC mainly for gisting purposes.

## Application
Readers can choose to machine translate USG on a sentence- or document-basis, depending on their needs and interests.

### Benefits
By resorting to machine translation, users widen their audience and engage different communities.
UGC is non-stop, and the amount of information published daily cannot be processed by a group of human translators. Using machine translation can help brands benefit from this content cross-border as a growing audience looks for this authentic and realistic information to make decisions related to purchases or subscriptions.

### Scope
- Comments
- Reviews
- Posts

### Potential issues
- Newly coined words or expressions
- Messages written by non-native speakers

Although typos could be considered a potential issue, many machine translation engines fix them before processing the translation.
