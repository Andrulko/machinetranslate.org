# User-Generated Content

Machine translation for **user-generated content (UGC)** is used mainly for **gisting**.
User-generated content is a good fit for machine translation because it is very high-scale.
User-generated content is challenging for machine translation because it is open-domain and noisy.


## Application
Readers can choose to machine translate USG on a sentence-basis.

### Goals
With machine translation, users widen their audience and engage different communities.
The amount of UGC published daily is non-stop. Machine translation makes UGC cross-border for growing audiences who look for product and services information.
