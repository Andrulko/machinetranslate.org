# Data confidentiality

**Data confidentiality** refers to how the machine translation providers use the specific data sent for translation. Providers can generate translations with or without storing the input. Machine translation providers need data to train and improve their translation service.

In systems with no confidentiality settings, input data can reappear in similar machine translation calls. Providers that offer no-trace never store data.

Free machine translation services have lower confidentiality levels than private machine translation services.

### Protection

Data protection is how machine translation providers protect data sent for translation in their platforms. Platforms may need a third party to transmit or store data.
