# Providers

Machine translation **providers** offer generic machine translation services with different customization possibilities. Machine translation services have different features and limitations.

The advantage of using a machine translation provider is that the service is already working and can be implemented immediately. The alternative is to train a machine translation engine from scratch.

Providers offer machine translation services via a platform, an API or both. Some providers offer limited services for free or paid full services.
