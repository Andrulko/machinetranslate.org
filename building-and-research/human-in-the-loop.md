title: Human-in-the-loop
description: Machine translation supported by human post-editing or evaluation
---

## Definition

Human-in-the-loop means using human feedback for additional training of translation engines.  
Human feedback can be provided in the following forms:
* Human corrections in post-edited machine translation
* Human error annotations in evaluated machine translation

## Goal

The goal of human-in-the-loop is improving the quality of machine translation output in all aspects:
* accuracy - eliminating factual errors and "hallucinating"
* fluency - making the language sound more natural
* terminology - using appropriate terms in given context

# Who does it

* Corrections are usually made by professional translators who aim at post-editing machine translation output to the quality of human translation
* Annotations can be made either by translators, or by other annotators trained for marking errors in a consistent way
