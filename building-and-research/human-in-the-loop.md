description: Machine translation supported by human post-editing or evaluation
---

## Definition

Human-in-the-loop means using human feedback for additional training of translation engines.  
Human feedback can be provided in the following forms:
* Human corrections in post-edited machine translation
* Human error annotations in evaluated machine translation
  
Other human-machine interactions are also assessed as human-in-the-loop:
* Human improvements to source content 
* Fallback option to human translation in case an automated solution is inadequate

## Goal

The goal of human-in-the-loop is improving the quality of machine translation output in all aspects:
* Accuracy - eliminating factual errors and "hallucinating"
* Fluency - making the language sound more natural
* Terminology - using appropriate terms in given context

## Tasks

These tasks can be performed by individuals or teams, depending on the specific requirements of the process that involves the machine translation and on the expected main purpose of translated content.

1. Pre-editing: Before feeding text into the machine translation system, human editors may pre-edit the source text to ensure that it is clear, concise, and easy to translate.

2. Machine Translation: The pre-edited text is then fed into a machine translation system, which generates an initial translation.

3. Post-editing: A human post-editor reviews the machine-generated translation and makes any necessary corrections to improve the quality of the final output. This task should be performed by professional translators or experienced post-editors.

4. Quality Assessment: Human quality assessors may be involved in evaluating the quality of the machine-generated translations and providing feedback to the machine translation system to help it improve over time. This taks is
